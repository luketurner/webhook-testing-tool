# Specification Quality Checklist: Database Admin CLI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: PASSED ✓

All quality criteria have been met. The specification is ready for planning phase.

### Detailed Validation Notes

**Content Quality**: All sections focus on user needs and business value. No technology-specific implementation details present. Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

**Requirements**: All 18 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. No clarification markers remain. Each requirement can be verified through concrete tests or measurements. Requirements include integration constraints (FR-016 to FR-018) specifying single executable architecture.

**Success Criteria**: All 6 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (time, percentage, counts). They describe user-facing outcomes without mentioning implementation technologies. Examples:
- SC-001: "30 seconds" - measurable time
- SC-003: "100%" - measurable percentage
- SC-006: "99%" - measurable success rate

**User Scenarios**: Three prioritized user stories (P1-P3) cover the core flows:
- P1: Credential management (security-critical)
- P2: Database export (data protection)
- P3: CLI user experience (usability)

Each story includes clear acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format and can be tested independently.

**Edge Cases**: 9 edge cases identified covering error conditions, scale limits, boundary conditions, and executable mode conflicts.

**Scope**: Clear boundaries defined in "Out of Scope" section. Dependencies and assumptions documented. Constraints explicitly stated.

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- No issues requiring resolution before proceeding to next phase
- All quality checklist items passed on first validation attempt
- **Update (2025-10-25)**: Specification updated to include single-executable architecture constraint
  - Added FR-016, FR-017, FR-018 for executable integration requirements
  - Updated User Story 3 acceptance scenarios to include default behavior preservation
  - Added 2 edge cases for executable mode handling
  - Updated Constraints and Assumptions sections
  - Validation re-run: ALL CHECKS STILL PASS ✓
