# Tasks: Archive and Delete Historical Data

**Input**: Design documents from `/workspace/specs/001-archive-delete-requests/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: This feature specification does NOT explicitly request tests. Tasks focus on implementation. Tests can be added later if needed per Constitution Principle V.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Single project structure with client/server separation:
- Server: `/workspace/src/` (TypeScript with Bun runtime)
- Client: `/workspace/src/dashboard/` (React 19)
- Database: `/workspace/src/db/`
- Shared: `/workspace/src/components/`, `/workspace/src/util/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Database Schema)

**Purpose**: Database migration to add archived_timestamp column

- [X] T001 Create database migration file `/workspace/src/db/migrations/<timestamp>_add_archived_timestamp_columns.ts` with ALTER TABLE statements for both requests and tcp_connections tables

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Schema & SSE Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Core schema changes and event infrastructure that ALL user stories depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T002 [P] Update RequestEvent schema in `/workspace/src/request-events/schema.ts` to add archived_timestamp field with timestampSchema.nullish()
- [X] T003 [P] Update TcpConnection schema in `/workspace/src/tcp-connections/schema.ts` to add archived_timestamp field with timestampSchema.nullish()
- [X] T004 Add SSE event types to `/workspace/src/db/events.ts` AppEvents interface: request:archived, request:unarchived, request:deleted, tcp_connection:archived, tcp_connection:unarchived, tcp_connection:deleted
- [X] T005 [P] Modify getAllRequestEventsMeta function in `/workspace/src/request-events/model.ts` to accept includeArchived parameter and filter by archived_timestamp IS NULL when false
- [X] T006 [P] Modify getAllTcpConnectionsMeta function in `/workspace/src/tcp-connections/model.ts` to accept includeArchived parameter and filter by archived_timestamp IS NULL when false

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Delete Individual) - Independent
  - US2 (Archive Individual) - Independent
  - US3 (Toggle Archived) - Requires US2 (needs archived items to show)
  - US4 (Bulk Delete) - Builds on US1 patterns
  - US5 (Bulk Archive) - Builds on US2 patterns
  - US6 (Unarchive) - Requires US2 and US3 (needs archive functionality and toggle to access archived items)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent (can run parallel with US1)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on US2 (needs archived items to display) - Cannot run until US2 complete
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Builds on US1 delete patterns - Should complete US1 first for consistency
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Builds on US2 archive patterns - Should complete US2 first
- **User Story 6 (P6)**: Depends on US2 (archive) and US3 (toggle) - Cannot start until both complete

### Within Each User Story

- Model functions before controller endpoints
- Backend endpoints before frontend UI components
- UI components before SSE event listeners
- Core functionality before error handling

### Parallel Opportunities

- Phase 2: T002 and T003 (schemas), T005 and T006 (model functions) can run in parallel
- Phase 3 (US1): T007, T008, T009 (models) can run in parallel; T010, T011, T012, T013 (endpoints) can run in parallel; T015, T016, T017, T018 (UI) can run after endpoints
- Phase 4 (US2): T022, T023 (models) parallel; T024, T025 (endpoints) parallel; T026, T027 (UI) parallel
- Phase 5 (US3): T031, T032 (toggles) parallel; T033, T034 (queries) parallel; T035, T036 (styling) parallel; T037, T038 (endpoints) parallel
- Phase 6 (US4): T039, T040 (dialogs) parallel; T041, T042 (empty states) parallel; T043, T044 (button logic) parallel
- Phase 7 (US5): T045, T046 (models) parallel; T047, T048 (endpoints) parallel; T049, T050 (UI) parallel; T051, T052 (mutations) parallel; T053, T054 (empty states) parallel
- Phase 8 (US6): T055, T056 (models) parallel; T057, T058 (buttons) parallel; T059, T060 (mutations) parallel; T062, T063 (endpoint logic) parallel
- Phase 9: T064, T065 (error handling) parallel; T069, T070 (tooling) parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch model functions together:
Task T022: "Add archiveRequestEvent function in src/request-events/model.ts"
Task T023: "Add archiveTcpConnection function in src/tcp-connections/model.ts"

# Launch endpoint implementations together:
Task T024: "Add PATCH /api/requests/:id endpoint in src/request-events/controller.ts"
Task T025: "Add PATCH /api/tcp-connections/:id endpoint in src/tcp-connections/controller.ts"

# Launch UI components together:
Task T026: "Add archive button to request sidenav items"
Task T027: "Add archive button to TCP connection sidenav items"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (database migration)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (schemas, SSE events, filters)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (delete individual items)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test delete functionality independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Delete) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 (Archive) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 (Toggle) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 (Bulk Delete) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 (Bulk Archive) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Add User Story 6 (Unarchive) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
8. Polish phase ‚Üí Final validation ‚Üí Production ready

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Delete Individual)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Archive Individual) - can run parallel with US1
3. After US1 and US2 complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 4 (Bulk Delete)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (Toggle) then User Story 6 (Unarchive)
   - Developer C: User Story 5 (Bulk Archive)
4. Stories integrate cleanly via shared SSE infrastructure

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1-US6)
- Each user story delivers independently testable functionality
- No test tasks included - feature spec does not explicitly request TDD approach
- Tests can be added later following patterns in quickstart.md
- Commit after completing each user story phase for clean history
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story works independently
- Use `bun run format` before committing
- Use `bun run compile` to verify TypeScript types
- Reference `/workspace/specs/001-archive-delete-requests/quickstart.md` for implementation patterns
- Add AIDEV-NOTE comments for complex SSE and bulk operation logic per Constitution Principle VI
