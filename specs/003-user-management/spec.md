# Feature Specification: User Management & Password Reset

**Feature Branch**: `001-user-management`
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "User management page with password reset functionality"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-25

- Q: When should email/password validation errors be displayed to the user? → A: Hybrid approach - format validation on blur, security validation on submit
- Q: How should the system handle concurrent credential update operations (e.g., user clicks submit button multiple times, or has page open in two browser tabs)? → A: Disable submit button during processing - prevent multiple submissions from same session
- Q: What should happen if the user's session expires while they are on the user management page? → A: Automatically redirect to login page (no return to management page after login)
- Q: Should passwords be allowed to contain special characters, spaces, or emoji? → A: Allow all characters - including spaces, emoji, and unicode (recommended by NIST)
- User emails are not verified, because the system currently does not have email-sending capabilities

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View User Profile (Priority: P1)

As the admin user, I need to view my current account information (email and password status) so that I can verify my credentials and account settings.

**Why this priority**: Foundation for user management - must be able to see current state before making changes. This is the minimum viable increment that provides value by giving visibility into the admin account.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging into the admin dashboard and navigating to the user management page. Delivers value by showing current admin email and account creation timestamp.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in as the admin user, **When** I navigate to the user management page, **Then** I see my current email address displayed
2. **Given** I am logged in as the admin user, **When** I view the user management page, **Then** I see when my account was created
3. **Given** I am not logged in, **When** I try to access the user management page, **Then** I am redirected to the login page
4. **Given** I am viewing the user management page, **When** my session expires, **Then** I am redirected to the login page

### User Story 2 - Update Email Address (Priority: P2)

As the admin user, I need to update my email address so that I can keep my login credentials current if my email changes.

**Why this priority**: Common account maintenance task. Depends on viewing profile (P1) but is independently useful. Users can update their contact information without needing password reset functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by viewing profile, changing email, logging out, and logging back in with the new email.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the user management page, **When** I enter a new valid email address and submit, **Then** my email is updated and I see a success message
2. **Given** I have updated my email, **When** I log out and log back in with the new email and existing password, **Then** authentication succeeds
3. **Given** I am on the user management page, **When** I enter an invalid email format and move to another field, **Then** I see a validation error immediately without submitting
4. **Given** I am on the user management page, **When** I submit the form with an empty email, **Then** I see a validation error
5. **Given** I am submitting an email update, **When** form submission is in progress, **Then** the submit button is disabled and shows a loading indicator

### User Story 3 - Reset Password (Priority: P3)

As the admin user, I need to change my password so that I can maintain account security and update my credentials if I suspect they've been compromised.

**Why this priority**: Important security feature but not required for basic profile management. Can be implemented after email updates are working.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing profile, initiating password reset, entering new password, logging out, and logging in with new password.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the user management page, **When** I enter my current password, a new password, and confirm the new password, and submit, **Then** my password is updated and I see a success message
2. **Given** I have updated my password, **When** I log out and log back in with my email and new password, **Then** authentication succeeds
3. **Given** I am resetting my password, **When** I enter an incorrect current password and submit, **Then** I see an error message and the password is not changed
4. **Given** I am resetting my password, **When** I enter a new password and confirmation that don't match, and move to another field, **Then** I see a validation error immediately without submitting
5. **Given** I am resetting my password, **When** I enter a password shorter than 8 characters and move to another field, **Then** I see a validation error immediately without submitting
6. **Given** I successfully reset my password, **When** I try to log in with my old password, **Then** authentication fails

### Edge Cases

- Concurrent submissions from the same session are prevented by disabling the submit button during processing
- Email addresses longer than 254 characters are rejected during validation (per FR-014)
- Session expiration redirects user to login page without preserving return URL (per FR-020, FR-021)
- Passwords may contain any printable characters including spaces, emoji, and unicode (per FR-007a)
- Email verification is explicitly out of scope - system has no email-sending capabilities (per FR-022, FR-023)
- Updated email addresses are immediately active for login without any confirmation step
- What happens if the user navigates away during form submission?
- How does the system prevent timing attacks that could reveal whether an email exists?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display the current admin user's email address
- **FR-002**: System MUST display the admin account creation timestamp
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow the admin user to update their email address
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate email addresses using standard email format validation
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow the admin user to change their password by providing current password, new password, and password confirmation
- **FR-006**: System MUST verify the current password before allowing password changes
- **FR-007**: System MUST require new passwords to be at least 8 characters long

- **SR-004**: Failed password change attempts SHOULD be logged for security auditing
- **SR-005**: System MUST use the existing better-auth security mechanisms for password hashing

### Key Entities

- **Admin User**: Represents the single admin user account with email, password hash, and creation timestamp
- **Session**: User authentication session that must be updated when credentials change

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Admin user can view their current email address within 2 seconds of page load
- **SC-002**: Admin user can successfully update their email address and log in with new credentials within 30 seconds
- **SC-003**: Admin user can successfully change their password and log in with new credentials within 45 seconds
- **SC-004**: Invalid email formats are rejected with clear error messages before submission
- **SC-005**: Password change attempts with incorrect current password are rejected with clear error messages
- **SC-006**: 100% of password changes use secure hashing (no plain text storage)
- **SC-007**: Updated credentials work immediately upon successful submission (no delay or caching issues)
- **SC-008**: User receives clear, actionable feedback for all validation errors

### Assumptions

- The system continues to use better-auth for authentication and session management
- The system continues to support single-user mode (one admin account)
- Admin credentials are configured via environment variables for initial setup, but this feature allows runtime updates
- Email validation follows RFC 5322 standards
- Password strength requirements follow NIST guidelines: minimum 8 characters with no character type restrictions, allowing full unicode support for maximum entropy and user choice
- The user management page will be part of the existing admin dashboard UI
- The feature will use existing shadcn/ui components for forms and inputs
- Session management automatically handles credential updates (no manual logout required)
- The system does not have email-sending capabilities, therefore email verification is not required or implemented
- Email addresses are used solely for authentication purposes and are immediately active after update
