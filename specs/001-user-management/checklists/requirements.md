- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review

✅ **No implementation details**: Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW. References to better-auth and shadcn/ui are in Assumptions section (appropriate context).

✅ **User value focused**: All user stories describe admin user needs and benefits. Requirements are framed around user capabilities.

✅ **Non-technical language**: Written in plain language understandable by stakeholders. Technical terms (email validation, password hashing) are kept to necessary minimum for security requirements.

✅ **All mandatory sections completed**: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, and Success Criteria all present and comprehensive.

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: Specification uses reasonable defaults based on industry standards and WTT's single-user context.

✅ **Testable and unambiguous requirements**: All 23 functional requirements and 5 security requirements are specific and verifiable. Examples:
- FR-004: "System MUST validate email addresses using standard email format validation" - testable with valid/invalid email inputs
- FR-022: "System MUST NOT require email verification when updating email addresses" - testable by updating email and immediately logging in
- SR-001: "Password change MUST require current password verification" - testable by attempting password change without current password

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All 8 success criteria include specific metrics:
- SC-001: "within 2 seconds of page load"
- SC-002: "within 30 seconds"
- SC-003: "within 45 seconds"
- SC-006: "100% of password changes"

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Success criteria focus on user experience and outcomes, not implementation:
- ✅ "Admin user can view their current email address within 2 seconds"
- ✅ "Invalid email formats are rejected with clear error messages"
- ✅ "100% of password changes use secure hashing"

✅ **All acceptance scenarios defined**: 3 user stories with comprehensive acceptance scenarios (11 total scenarios covering happy paths, validation, and security).

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 8 edge cases covering concurrent operations, boundary conditions, navigation, character handling, session expiration, email verification exclusion, and security.

✅ **Scope clearly bounded**: Single-user admin account management only. No multi-user support, no role management, no account recovery flows beyond password reset, and no email verification (system lacks email-sending capabilities).

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions identified**: Assumptions section lists 10 clear assumptions about existing systems (better-auth), deployment model (single-user), technical standards (RFC 5322), and email verification exclusion.

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria**: User stories map to functional requirements with testable acceptance scenarios.

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**:
- P1: View profile (foundation)
- P2: Update email (common maintenance)
- P3: Reset password (security)

✅ **Feature meets measurable outcomes**: Success criteria align with user stories and provide clear pass/fail metrics.

✅ **No implementation details leak**: Specification maintains abstraction. References to better-auth, shadcn/ui, and session management are appropriately confined to Assumptions section.

## Notes

All checklist items pass. Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.

**Quality Assessment**: High quality specification with:
- Clear prioritization (P1→P2→P3 user stories)
- Independent testability for each user story
- Comprehensive security requirements
- Reasonable assumptions documented
- No ambiguity requiring clarification

**Update 2025-10-25**: Added explicit scope exclusion for email verification - system does not have email-sending capabilities, therefore email addresses are immediately active after update without verification. Added FR-022 and FR-023 to formalize this constraint.
