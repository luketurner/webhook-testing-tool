# `CLAUDE.md` - Webhook Testing Tool

## Project Context

Webhook Testing Took (WTT) is a self-hosted app for testing and debugging HTTP requests. It includes a generic HTTP server that responds to any request, as well as a React-based admin dashboard for viewing past requests and responses.

## Critical Architecture Decisions

### Zod Schemas

Zod schemas are preferred for validation and parsing because they are declarative and strongly typed. Zod should be used to parse data received from user input, database queries, or any other external data source.

### Bun Server

The admin dashboard is served with `Bun.serve` because it has a clean API and automatically bundles/compiles `.html` documents.

Whenever a new route is added in the admin dashboard router, it must also be added as a static route in `src/dashboard/server.ts`.

### Express Server

The webhook server uses Express because it allows you to write code after the response is sent by overwriting the `res.end` function.

### Frontend conventions

- Use components from shadcn/ui framework whenever possible. (https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components)
- New components can be installed with `bunx`, e.g. to install the `button` component, you'd run `bunx --bun shadcn@latest add button`.
- If there is no existing shadcn/ui component, create reusable components in `src/components` wherever possible.
- Use Tailwind classes for all styles.
- Do not edit files in `src/components/ui`, those are managed by the shadcn code generator.
- Do not edit `src/util/ui.ts`, that is required by the shadcn code generator.
- **Use the Link or NavLink components from react-router for client-side navigation.**

### Client-Server Architecture

WTT uses a single codebase (the `src/` directory) for both the client (React frontend) and server (Bun backend).

- The main Typescript entrypoint for the client is `src/dashboard/client.tsx`.
- The main Typescript entrypoint for the server is `src/server.ts`.

Some files are "server-only", indicated by `import "@/server-only";` being present in the file. These files must never be imported from the frontend.

## Code Style and Patterns

### Anchor comments

Add specially formatted comments throughout the codebase, where appropriate, for yourself as inline knowledge that can be easily `grep`ped for.

### Guidelines:

- Use `AIDEV-NOTE:`, `AIDEV-TODO:`, or `AIDEV-QUESTION:` (all-caps prefix) for comments aimed at AI and developers.
- **Important:** Before scanning files, always first try to **grep for existing anchors** `AIDEV-*` in relevant subdirectories.
- **Update relevant anchors** when modifying associated code.
- **Do not remove `AIDEV-NOTE`s** without explicit human instruction.
- Make sure to add relevant anchor comments, whenever a file or piece of code is:
  - too complex, or
  - very important, or
  - confusing, or
  - could have a bug

### Organize your project by feature areas

Organize your project into subdirectories based on the features or your application or common themes to the code in those directories.

Avoid creating subdirectories based on the type of code that lives in those directories. For example, avoid creating directories like components, directives, and services.

Avoid putting so many files into one directory that it becomes hard to read or navigate. As the number files in a directory grows, consider splitting further into additional sub-directories.

### One concept per file

Prefer focusing source files on a single concept. When in doubt, go with the approach that leads to smaller files.

### Util directory

If a helper function would be useful across multiple feature areas, put it in an appropriate file in the `./src/util` directory.

## Development Best Practices

- NEVER use the `any` type to fix TypeScript errors.
- Use `bun` for all package management commands. DO NOT use `npm`.
- Commit messages should tersely explain what changed without excessive prose.
- Prefix all commit messages with "claude: "
- Use `bun run format` to format code changes.
- Use `bun run compile` to compile code changes. DO NOT use `bunx tsc`.

<!-- BACKLOG.MD GUIDELINES START -->
# Instructions for the usage of Backlog.md CLI Tool

## 1. Source of Truth

- Tasks live under **`backlog/tasks/`** (drafts under **`backlog/drafts/`**).
- Every implementation decision starts with reading the corresponding Markdown task file.
- Project documentation is in **`backlog/docs/`**.
- Project decisions are in **`backlog/decisions/`**.

## 2. Defining Tasks

### **Title**

Use a clear brief title that summarizes the task.

### **Description**: (The **"why"**)

Provide a concise summary of the task purpose and its goal. Do not add implementation details here. It
should explain the purpose and context of the task. Code snippets should be avoided.

### **Acceptance Criteria**: (The **"what"**)

List specific, measurable outcomes that define what means to reach the goal from the description. Use checkboxes (`- [ ]`) for tracking.
When defining `## Acceptance Criteria` for a task, focus on **outcomes, behaviors, and verifiable requirements** rather
than step-by-step implementation details.
Acceptance Criteria (AC) define *what* conditions must be met for the task to be considered complete.
They should be testable and confirm that the core purpose of the task is achieved.
**Key Principles for Good ACs:**

- **Outcome-Oriented:** Focus on the result, not the method.
- **Testable/Verifiable:** Each criterion should be something that can be objectively tested or verified.
- **Clear and Concise:** Unambiguous language.
- **Complete:** Collectively, ACs should cover the scope of the task.
- **User-Focused (where applicable):** Frame ACs from the perspective of the end-user or the system's external behavior.

    - *Good Example:* "- [ ] User can successfully log in with valid credentials."
    - *Good Example:* "- [ ] System processes 1000 requests per second without errors."
    - *Bad Example (Implementation Step):* "- [ ] Add a new function `handleLogin()` in `auth.ts`."

### Task file

Once a task is created it will be stored in `backlog/tasks/` directory as a Markdown file with the format
`task-<id> - <title>.md` (e.g. `task-42 - Add GraphQL resolver.md`).

### Additional task requirements

- Tasks must be **atomic** and **testable**. If a task is too large, break it down into smaller subtasks.
  Each task should represent a single unit of work that can be completed in a single PR.

- **Never** reference tasks that are to be done in the future or that are not yet created. You can only reference
  previous
  tasks (id < current task id).

- When creating multiple tasks, ensure they are **independent** and they do not depend on future tasks.   
  Example of wrong tasks splitting: task 1: "Add API endpoint for user data", task 2: "Define the user model and DB
  schema".  
  Example of correct tasks splitting: task 1: "Add system for handling API requests", task 2: "Add user model and DB
  schema", task 3: "Add API endpoint for user data".

## 3. Recommended Task Anatomy

```markdown
# task‑42 - Add GraphQL resolver

## Description (the why)

Short, imperative explanation of the goal of the task and why it is needed.

## Acceptance Criteria (the what)

- [ ] Resolver returns correct data for happy path
- [ ] Error response matches REST
- [ ] P95 latency ≤ 50 ms under 100 RPS

## Implementation Plan (the how)

1. Research existing GraphQL resolver patterns
2. Implement basic resolver with error handling
3. Add performance monitoring
4. Write unit and integration tests
5. Benchmark performance under load

## Implementation Notes (only added after working on the task)

- Approach taken
- Features implemented or modified
- Technical decisions and trade-offs
- Modified or added files
```

## 6. Implementing Tasks

Mandatory sections for every task:

- **Implementation Plan**: (The **"how"**) Outline the steps to achieve the task. Because the implementation details may
  change after the task is created, **the implementation notes must be added only after putting the task in progress**
  and before starting working on the task.
- **Implementation Notes**: Document your approach, decisions, challenges, and any deviations from the plan. This
  section is added after you are done working on the task. It should summarize what you did and why you did it. Keep it
  concise but informative.

**IMPORTANT**: Do not implement anything else that deviates from the **Acceptance Criteria**. If you need to
implement something that is not in the AC, update the AC first and then implement it or create a new task for it.

## 2. Typical Workflow

```bash
# 1 Identify work
backlog task list -s "To Do" --plain

# 2 Read details & documentation
backlog task 42 --plain
# Read also all documentation files in `backlog/docs/` directory.
# Read also all decision files in `backlog/decisions/` directory.

# 3 Start work: assign yourself & move column
backlog task edit 42 -a @{yourself} -s "In Progress"

# 4 Add implementation plan before starting
backlog task edit 42 --plan "1. Analyze current implementation\n2. Identify bottlenecks\n3. Refactor in phases"

# 5 Break work down if needed by creating subtasks or additional tasks
backlog task create "Refactor DB layer" -p 42 -a @{yourself} -d "Description" --ac "Tests pass,Performance improved"

# 6 Complete and mark Done
backlog task edit 42 -s Done --notes "Implemented GraphQL resolver with error handling and performance monitoring"
```

### 7. Final Steps Before Marking a Task as Done

Always ensure you have:

1. ✅ Marked all acceptance criteria as completed (change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`)
2. ✅ Added an `## Implementation Notes` section documenting your approach
3. ✅ Run all tests and linting checks
4. ✅ Updated relevant documentation

## 8. Definition of Done (DoD)

A task is **Done** only when **ALL** of the following are complete:

1. **Acceptance criteria** checklist in the task file is fully checked (all `- [ ]` changed to `- [x]`).
2. **Implementation plan** was followed or deviations were documented in Implementation Notes.
3. **Automated tests** (unit + integration) cover new logic.
4. **Static analysis**: linter & formatter succeed.
5. **Documentation**:
    - All relevant docs updated (any relevant README file, backlog/docs, backlog/decisions, etc.).
    - Task file **MUST** have an `## Implementation Notes` section added summarising:
        - Approach taken
        - Features implemented or modified
        - Technical decisions and trade-offs
        - Modified or added files
6. **Review**: self review code.
7. **Task hygiene**: status set to **Done** via CLI (`backlog task edit <id> -s Done`).
8. **No regressions**: performance, security and licence checks green.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Never mark a task as Done without completing ALL items above.

## 10. Tips for AI Agents

- **Always use `--plain` flag** when listing or viewing tasks for AI-friendly text output instead of using Backlog.md
  interactive UI.
- When users mention to create a task, they mean to create a task using Backlog.md CLI tool.
