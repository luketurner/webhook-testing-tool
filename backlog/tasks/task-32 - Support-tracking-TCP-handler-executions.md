## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Research existing HTTP handler execution implementation patterns
2. Create tcp-handler-executions directory with schema, model, and controller files
3. Create migration for tcp_handler_executions table
4. Update tcp-server to track executions (create on start, update on completion)
5. Update tcp-connection-page.tsx to display handler executions
6. Update db/index.ts to import migration and clear function
7. Write comprehensive tests for all new functionality

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Successfully implemented TCP handler execution tracking with the following changes:

**Implementation Approach:**
- Followed the existing HTTP handler execution pattern to maintain consistency
- Created a new tcp-handler-executions module with schema, model, and controller
- Added database migration for the tcp_handler_executions table with foreign key to tcp_connections
- Integrated execution tracking into the TCP server's data handler

**Features Implemented:**
1. TCP handler execution tracking with status (running, success, error)
2. Console output capture from handler execution
3. Error message tracking for failed executions
4. Execution order tracking for multiple data events per connection
5. Display of handler executions on the TCP connection page
6. Full API endpoint for fetching handler executions by connection ID

**Modified/Added Files:**
- src/tcp-handler-executions/schema.ts - Zod schemas for validation
- src/tcp-handler-executions/model.ts - Database CRUD operations
- src/tcp-handler-executions/controller.ts - API endpoint handler
- src/tcp-handler-executions/*.spec.ts - Comprehensive test suite (41 tests)
- src/db/migrations/1760318122000_add_tcp_handler_executions_table.ts - Database migration
- src/tcp-server/index.ts - Integration of execution tracking
- src/dashboard/pages/tcp-connection-page.tsx - UI for displaying executions
- src/components/tcp-handler-execution-item.tsx - Execution display component
- src/dashboard/hooks.ts - Hook for fetching TCP handler executions
- src/types/api.ts - Added tcp-handler-executions resource type
- src/db/index.ts - Added migration and clear function
- src/dashboard/server.ts - Registered controller route

**Technical Decisions:**
- Used same execution status types as HTTP handlers for consistency
- Tracked execution order per connection to handle multiple data events
- Captured console output in a single field as newline-separated string
- Omitted response_data and locals_data fields as TCP handlers only use send() and shared state
- Created execution record before handler runs with 'running' status, then update to 'success' or 'error'

All tests passing (41/41) and code successfully compiled with no TypeScript errors.
<!-- SECTION:NOTES:END -->

Add a new `tcp-handler-execution` model for tracking TCP handler executions like we do for HTTP `handler-executions`. This involves:

1. Creating a new tcp-handler-execution model and migration.
1. Creating a tcp-handler-execution schema.
2. Creating a tcp-handler-execution controller.
3. Updating the `tcp-connection-page.tsx` to display the handler executions during that connection.
4. Updating the `tcp-server` to create and update handler executions when handlers are executed. (Make sure to track the console outputs as well).
5. Adding automated tests.
